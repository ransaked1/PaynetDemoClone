- To start the demo of the day, execute the file "demoDxx.app" with
  The command: "open ./demoDxx.app", or "Dxx" of course corresponds
  To the present day.

- The orders for the demo of the day are:
  - Left and right to move the characters (or A and D).
  - Space to jump.
  - 1, 2, or 3 to select the active character.
  - R to restart the scene.
  - N to jump directly to next level

- If one of your characters dies at the last level the screen will become
  Grey. Simply press R to restart the level.

- To import the assets delivered today, you must first open
  Unity normally, create or open an existing project, then open
  The file "assetsDxx.unitypackage" with the command "open
  AssetsDxx.unitypackage ", or" Dxx "corresponds of course to the day
  this. A small pop-up will ask you for confirmation
  Importing assets. After validation, the assets will be
  Available in your project.

- The assets provided during this pool are the property of their
  Authors and can only be used for
  pedagogical. You can not redistribute them freely.

- For the last financial year you do not have any specific assets provided
  For turrets and bullets. It's up to you to make a tweak
  Some images (use the demo as an example if you do not have an idea)
