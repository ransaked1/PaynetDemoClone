# PaynetDemoClone
This project was inspired by my one week internship at [Paynet](https://paynet.md/), a software company specializing in payment solutions. While outsorcing for foreign companies, Paynet also has an innovative virtual wallet for the local market enabling its users to receive and make payments in fiat or cryptocurrency. As a learning experience I set out to mimick the [Android app's UI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=md.fusionworks.paynet&hl=en) using Android Studio (Material Design) with Java. In the process I learned the basics of creating static and dynamic layouts with responsive buttons and elements. In the end I presented my application and a list of recommendations/suggestions for the UI/UX of the original application.
